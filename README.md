# Chess-Validator
A program that reads a state of a chess from a file and prints for each piece the list of moves it can do.

The program recognizes every piece with a char, and a struct for every piece implements the list of the moves it can do.
The chess is seen as a matrix 8x8 in which there are white and black pieces, the first are lower case characters, the second uppercase.
